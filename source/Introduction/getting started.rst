.. note:: EEex officially supports Baldurs Gate II Enhanced Edition **v2.5.16.6** currently. However EEex `should` be compatible with almost all Enhanced Edition games **except** for Plainscape Torment Enhanced Edition, which has some notable differences from other Enhanced Edition games that prevents EEex from successfully working with it.


For all general users of EEex, please follow the relevant :ref:`installation guide<Installation>`:
