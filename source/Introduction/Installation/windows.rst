EEex is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a `WeiDU installer <http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg/>`_. 

To install: 

- Double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.

or alternatively:

- Extract files into your game directory using `7zip <http://www.7-zip.org/download.html>`_ or `WinRAR <http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm>`_. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain **setup-EEex.exe** and the folder **EEex**. 
- Double-click **setup-EEex.exe** and follow the instructions on screen.


.. note:: Once EEex is installed, you will **not** be able to start the game by clicking on the main game executable (``Baldur.exe``, ``Icewind.exe`` or ``SiegeOfDragonspear.exe``) or using shortucts that link to those game executables. You must click on the **EEex.exe**, or create a shortcut that links to **EEex.exe** instead. **EEex.exe** can be found in your game's folder.


.. note:: Uninstall - You can run ``setup-EEex.exe`` in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.
