Mac OS X Installation
=====================

EEex for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a `WeiDU installer <http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg/>`_.

To install:

- Extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain **setup-EEex**, **setup-EEex.command**, and the folder **EEex**. 
- Double-click ``setup-EEex.command`` and follow the instructions on screen.


.. note:: Once EEex is installed, you will **not** be able to start the game by executing the main game program (``Baldur``, ``Icewind`` or ``SiegeOfDragonspear``) or using shortucts that link to those game programs. You must execute the **EEex** program, or create a shortcut that links to **EEex** program instead. **EEex** can be found in your game's folder.


.. note:: Uninstall - You can run ``setup-EEex.command`` in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.
