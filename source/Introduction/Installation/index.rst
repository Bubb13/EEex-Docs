Installation
============

.. note:: **Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG** - `Good Old Games (GOG) <https://www.gog.com/game/baldurs_gate_siege_of_dragonspear>`_ and `Steam <https://store.steampowered.com/app/385970/Baldurs_Gate_Siege_of_Dragonspear/>`_ both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that `WeiDU <http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg/>`_, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called `Modmerge <https://github.com/ScottBrooks/modmerge>`_ on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.


.. note:: **Beamdog Enhanced Editions** - The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
