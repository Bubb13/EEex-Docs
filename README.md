# EEex Documentation
EEex is an executable extender for Beamdog's Enhanced Edition of the Infinity Engine. Its goal is to externalize certain parts of the engine to grant modders a greater degree of control over otherwise hardcoded mechanics. EEex does not make any gameplay changes itself - it merely enables other mods to do so.
